- 👋 Hi, I’m a C programmer / old dog that excellent young developers are teaching new tricks as I moved in to Web front-end and middleware developing group.
- 👀 I’m interested in Angular, SQL and Spring Boot at this time, but ultimately I would want to dive into the machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and Spring Boot at work.  Programming UI stuff is really interesting!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a mid to large research project if there is any which I can learn and contribute after work.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is frank1228.choi@gmail.com.
